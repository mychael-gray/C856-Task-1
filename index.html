Tropical Paradise of Taniti
</h1>






<p id="tropicalBayText">

Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area 
of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and
 rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a 
mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an 
indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism,
 most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
