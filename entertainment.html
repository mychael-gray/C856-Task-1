Entertainment: Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the 
rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do,
 including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours,
 snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including 
a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter
 rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a 
nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these 
activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing 
area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.
